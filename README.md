# Hospital-Readmission-Classification

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to apply machine learning concepts focusing on Classification and Model Performance, including Bias-variance tradeoff and Cross-validation. This analysis aims to enable students to:

- Analyze the Hospital Readmission Dataset
- Perform comprehensive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Develop predictive models using appropriate classification algorithms
- Critically evaluate the model's performance

Hospital readmission is a critical healthcare metric that affects patient outcomes and healthcare costs. This project seeks to predict the likelihood of patient readmission, which can help healthcare providers take preventive measures and improve patient care quality.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **Hospital Readmission Dataset**, which contains patient information and hospital visit records. The dataset is used to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within a specific timeframe.

### Key Dataset Features:
- Patient demographic information
- Medical history and diagnoses
- Treatment and medication data
- Previous admission records
- Hospital stay duration
- Target variable: Readmission status

## Project Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning and Visualization (5 Marks)
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Remove duplicate records
- Data type conversions and formatting
- Initial visualization of data distributions
- Quality assessment of dataset

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Analysis (10 Marks)
- Univariate analysis of features
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis
- Correlation analysis between features
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Feature distribution analysis
- Identification of patterns and trends
- Visual representation of key insights

### 3. Model Development and Evaluation (15 Marks)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)
- Train-test split and cross-validation setup
- Implementation of classification algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Gradient Boosting (if applicable)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model performance evaluation using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Cross-validation scores
- Bias-variance tradeoff analysis
- Model comparison and selection
- Final model interpretation and insights
